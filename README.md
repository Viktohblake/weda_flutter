## The Goal

On making of this project I learnt asynchronous programming in Dart. Carried out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 

## What project  is all about

This weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). This app can get the weather report of your current location or any location/city you can think of!
